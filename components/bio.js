                Happy to see that youâ€™d like to read more words from me.
                <br />I consider myself a refugee in this chaotic world. I feel
                displaced because somehow we're doomed to feel lonely.

                I believe that if we share what we have, we can tear down the
                walls between us and find out who / what we belong to.

                When I was little, my curiosity took me to the game universe. I
                played games then <strong>changed</strong> what I played. This
                universe has driven me to become a self-taught developer who has
                a design spirit inside. I shared what I learn on my way.

                Thanks to the internet and freelance web projects, I started
                working early then I studied Visual Communication Design and
                practiced different visual disciplines.

                On the professional side, I'm trying to call myself a React
                enthusiast and an evangelist of Design Standards.

                Throughout my entire career, I've built many bridges between
                frontend and design. I am a good observer when it comes to
                identifying communication issues between people / tools.

                I believe working together will be like playing with Legos if we
                build a structure with well-defined constraints.

                On the social side, I feel a mix of a carpenter and a koala. You
                might find me trying to be a spiritual man at a table full of
                rational people.
