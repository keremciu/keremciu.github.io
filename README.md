# keremciu.github.io

This is my personal website. It's bootstrapped with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

# usage

You can run this project locally `npm run dev` after `npm install`

I use Github Actions to deploy output of nextjs to `gh-pages` branch.

# purpose

I'd like to express myself other than my professional background. I feel that my
professional background is reachable but doesn't include my personality.

Hope you can find some details here.

If you have any question, please feel free to reach out.
